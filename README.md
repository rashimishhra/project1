# project1 - UK Parliament's Record of MP Suspensions from 2011-2024
 
 This is my repository where I try to visualise the duration of suspensions of UK MPs from 2011 to 2014. 

 This data spans from 2011 to 2024, coinciding with the Tories' rise to power under David Cameron in 2010. The following decade proved politically turbulent, marked by Brexit and frequent leadership changes as the party struggled to maintain control. During this period, Parliament implemented several key reforms. The 2018 Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme introduced new policies on behavior, bullying, harassment, and sexual misconduct; 2020 saw the creation of the Independent Expert Panel for handling appeals and sanctions. Earlier, in 2010, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) was established following MP expenses scandals. 

 Initially I wanted to chart the reasons for which these MPs were suspended. Tough I have included the reasons in my story, I was unable to visualise it as there was no specific reason listed and most of the columns in the data on UK Parliament House of Commons Library. It was difficult to categorise them into disorderly conduct, breach of parliamentary code of conduct. As the reasons in those documents were not categorised such. 

 I have also tried to visualise the years in which more MPs were suspended, alongwith grouping number of MPs who were suspended for similar durations. 

 Also, while comparing, I have changed the durations provided in months, weeks, and even sitting days to simply days, for the ease of calculation. Although if there is any difference adhering to Parliamentary suspensions of sitting days and days in the UK, I couldn't find.
